question-1)write a blog on difference between document object and window objects?


Document Object:
 The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access 
the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document
 object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.

some methods of document are-
1.getElementById(): It returns the object of the given ID. If no object with that id exists then it returns null
2.getElementsByTagName(): It returns an object containing all the elements with the specified tag names in the document as objects.
3.querySelector(): It returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document.



Window Object: The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window or frame that
 displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document,
 the window object is created. 

some methods of windows are-
1.alert(): It is used to display an alert box. It displays a specified message along with an OK button and is generally
 used to make sure that the information comes through the user.
2.setInterval(): It repeats a given function at every given time interval.
3.setTimeout(): It executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.
